How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

The Airgead Banking App was developed to help high school students understand the importance of fiscal responsibility, particularly in the areas of investing and compound interest. By allowing users to input their initial investment, monthly contributions, interest rate, and investment duration, the application provides an interactive way to visualize how their money grows over time. The goal of this project was to give students practical insights into financial planning, encouraging them to make informed decisions about saving and investing.

One of the key strengths of my implementation was the use of an object-oriented programming (OOP) approach, which ensured a well-structured and modular design. I created clear and efficient classes to handle user input, perform calculations, and format output. Additionally, I placed emphasis on user experience by providing clear prompts and well-structured displays of investment growth over time. Secure coding practices were also a priority, as I implemented robust input validation to prevent incorrect or unrealistic entries.

While the project met its functional requirements, there are areas where improvements could be made. Optimizing the compound interest calculation by reducing redundant computations would enhance efficiency. Expanding input validation to detect extreme values or incorrect formats could further strengthen the program’s security. Additionally, developing a graphical user interface (GUI) using Qt or a web-based framework would improve usability and engagement. Implementing file persistence to allow users to save and load investment scenarios would also make the application more practical for real-world use.

One of the biggest challenges was ensuring the compound interest calculations worked correctly across different input scenarios. To overcome this, I tested multiple cases and cross-referenced results with online financial calculators. Handling user input in a secure and intuitive manner was also a challenge, but implementing error handling and using clear prompts helped make the process smoother. Formatting the output for readability required the use of C++’s iomanip library to ensure investment projections were displayed neatly and professionally. Throughout the project, I relied on C++ documentation, Stack Overflow, and financial modeling resources to verify calculations and improve implementation.

The skills I gained from this project are highly transferable to other programming and data analysis tasks. Object-oriented design principles will be useful for structuring code in future projects, while implementing algorithms for calculations and data processing is a fundamental skill applicable across many domains. Secure coding practices, such as input validation and error handling, are essential for writing reliable and user-friendly applications. Additionally, understanding financial modeling concepts such as compound interest and investment projections could be valuable in future financial or data-driven projects.

To ensure maintainability, readability, and adaptability, I structured the code using modular functions, making future modifications straightforward. I followed consistent naming conventions and added in-line comments to explain the logic behind key sections. This approach not only makes the program easier to understand for future developers but also allows for scalability, should additional features like financial goal tracking or alternative investment strategies be introduced. Overall, the Airgead Banking App serves as a strong foundation for teaching students about financial literacy while demonstrating best practices in software development.
